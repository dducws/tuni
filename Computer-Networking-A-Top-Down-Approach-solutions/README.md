# Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Solutions

![Book Cover](Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach-solutions/utils/book_cover.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the solutions for exercises from the book *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* (6th edition). This project started during my enrollment in **Computer Networking I - COMM.NET.200** at Tampere University in Summer 2024.

Given the concise lecture slides and limited assistance available during the summer implementation, I hope these solutions will aid you in your studies or independent learning journey through the book.


## About This Folder

This folder is part of a larger repository containing all the materials I worked on during my time at the university. This section includes solutions for the book, which is the primary resource for the course, alongside recorded videos and lecture slides (as of 2024). Although newer editions of the book (such as the 7th or 8th) are available, these solutions correspond to the 6th edition, for which my university provided an electronic license. Most exercises remain largely unchanged in newer editions, with only minor reordering, so these solutions should still be useful.


## How to Use This Folder

- The name of each chapter's problems and solutions corresponds to its content in the book. 


## Feedback and Contributions

Mistakes are unavoidable, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. You can contribute in the following ways:

- **Discussions**: Use the Discussions tab "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Solutions" for general feedback and discussions.
- **Pull Requests**: Feel free to suggest changes or improvements through pull requests.


## Future Plans

I plan to complete solutions for all remaining problems in the book. Stay tuned for updates!

Happy learning!
